### Note: this spec is wildly out of date and I'm waiting until I have a working end-to-end implementation of the language before I bring it up to speed.

# gx-spec

This is the specification for the gx language, in LaTeX form. The
`current` directory contains the version of the spec for a given version
of the repository. For previous versions, check the `current` directory
of the various tags on this repository. `current` on master will always
be the development version of the spec.

For PDF builds of the spec, check the GitHub Releases tab.
