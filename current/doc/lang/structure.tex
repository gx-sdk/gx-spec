\section{Project Structure}

A \gx{} program is a collection of multiple {\tt .gx} source files which
form one logical project. The \gx{} compiler builds entire projects
directly from their source files. This is possible because the ROM output
is at most 4 megabytes in size, which should fit comfortably in memory
on any modern system.

The project itself is a bucket of ``units'', which are little more than
namespaces. Units are closely tied to the memory model.

Within each unit is a collection of code segments in the form of
functions, storage declarations, and type declarations.
