\chapter{\gx{} Language Overview}
\label{chap:lang-overview}

The central component of the \gx{} SDK is the \gx{} language, often
simply referred to as ``\gx{}''. In context it should be clear if
``\gx{}'' is referring to the SDK as a whole, or just the language,
but to disambiguate, the terms ``\gx{} SDK'' and ``\gx{} language'' or
just ``\gx{}lang'' will be used. This chapter gives a brief overview of
various important language features.

\chapter{\gx{} Language Specification}
\label{chap:lang-spec}

This chapter fully specifies a compliant \gx{} language implementation,
however it is not good for learning the language or reviewing its
features; chapter \ref{chap:lang-overview} is written with these uses in
mind. This chapter serves as the official resource on anything related
to the \gx{} language version \gxVersion{}.
