\chapter{\gx{} Language Specification}

The central component of the \gx{} SDK is the \gx{} language, often
simply referred to as ``\gx{}''. In context it should be clear if
``\gx{}'' is referring to the SDK as a whole, or just the language,
but to disambiguate, the terms ``\gx{} SDK'' and ``\gx{} language''
or just ``\gx{}lang'' will be used.

This chapter describes the \gx{} language in detail, and serves as the
official resource on anything related to the \gx{} language version
\gxVersion{}.
